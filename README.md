## Visualization Overview
The purpose of this project is to visualize the concentration of profanity in each of Tarantino's films. In the main page, the stacked pie chart shows the concentrations of profanity in 5 minute intervals in each film. Each colored arc represents one film and they are ordered from oldest to newest films from the inside out. Users will be able to hover over each section in an arc in order to see details about what profanity was most conmmonly used and what the total number of profanity during that time interval was. By clicking on a section of the arc, users will be taken to a histogram that provides more detail about the use of profanity in that specific film. Upon selecting the interval from the pie chart, the corresponding time interval in the histogram will be highlighted. In the histogram, the y-axis represents the number of profanity while the x-axis represents the time stamp of the movie at which the profanity occurred. Users can hover over the dots to see what exact word each point refers to. Note that there is a dropdown menu that lets the users change which movie they want to look at through the histogram view
